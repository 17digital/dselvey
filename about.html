				<p>
				Born Demetric Hull, this powerful and anointed songbird is a native a small town in Northeast Georgia where she spent her teenage years just across the street from her &quot;home&quot; church New Springhill Baptist. It was here at this church that Demetric began her early grooming years in the choir mainly leading songs and making impacts on the congregation.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Demetric has been singing for as long as she can remember. She has said on many occasions &quot;I can remember laying on my bedroom floor with my eyes closed listening to the radio. I would imagine the notes from each song flowing from the radio speakers and hitting me in the face, bouncing off and landing in my ears. This is how I saw &amp; listened to music in my younger years.&quot; After winning a talent contest in Elementary school and being told by her music teacher, Mrs. Haney, that she had a very special talent, Demetric continued with her dream of singing.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Contrary to popular opinion, Demetric never dreamed of singing secular music, she felt the draw to the church in the years that she spent living across the street from her church. Growing up in a religion that did not allow her to attend &quot;traditional&quot; church she would sit in the yard and listen to the music coming from the Baptist church and cry because she longed to be involved. It wasn't long before she turned 19 and her &quot;rebellion&quot; was to run to that church and join the choir. After long rehearsals and enduring the excitement of finally getting to sing in a worship service with the choir, Dee's dreams were shattered when she was told that she could not sing because she was not a member of a church. Quickly making that technicality vanish, Dee was finally able to sing with the choir and she has not stopped since.
				</p>
				<img src="images/default/poloroid2.jpg" alt="Demetric Selvey" id="bio2" />
				<p>
				Moving from the traditional black baptist choir to the more contemporary christian atmosphere of Cornerstone Church of God, Demetric was exposed to the tutelage of Minister of Music, Pastor Lance Brooks, and his teaching techniques that included strict vocal and ear training. Although this was very different from her usual singing, she adapted and grew.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Now a member of the Praise and Worship team at World Changer's Church Norcross (as subsidiary of World Changer's Church International where the Senior Pastor and First Lady is Dr. Creflo A and Taffi L. Dollar) Demetric has begun to fine tune her talent and direct it towards the giver and her Lord Christ Jesus.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				It is because of a dream and prophetic word that Demetric has begun to step out on faith and release the vision that God has put in her heart. She states, &quot;I am an anointed singer and song writer. My songs are authored and given by God Himself and are specifically designed to draw those that He has chosen to Him. The trials that produce this music are trials that will help others and it is my goal to sing them to others and let them know that Christ died on the cross so that they can be delivered from all that plagues them. I am living proof that your past has nothing to do with your future when Christ is the head of your life. I aim to use the grace of song that God has placed on my life to bring others to him.&quot;
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Now on her own, Demetric has incorporated friends and family to collaborate with her on this debut album, and is confident that she will bring the uncompromising word of God to the lost and please her God by fulfilling His will for her life. Please enjoy the music, but better yet be victorious over the wiles of the devil.
				</p>
